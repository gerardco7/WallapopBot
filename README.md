# WallapopBot 🤖
This project is based on a Telegram bot that allows you to stay updated on new products posted on the [Wallapop](https://es.wallapop.com/) platform. I decided to develop this project because I was interested in purchasing a graphics card and the prices were skyrocketing.

## How to use it? 🚀
It's very easy to use. First, you need to access the Telegram bot called [WalaYeraBot](https://t.me/WalaYeraBot). You can use it either in a private chat or add it to a group with more people. It has two simple commands:

- `/start`: Initiates the conversation with the bot, and it will respond by indicating its correct deployment.
- `/busca`: Proceeds to search for the latest graphics cards on Wallapop. It will first show you the latest 6 graphics cards published, and while it's active, it will notify you each time a new graphics card is published.

## How was it built? 🏗️

## 📝TODO list
- Explore how it works with multiple users.
- Allow changing the item to search from the `/busca` command.
- Use pyspider instead of selenium.
- Skip the Wallapop tutorial to speed up the first 20 seconds of the search.
